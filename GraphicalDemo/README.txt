Math For Games Assessment 

This project, Graphical Demo, was created in Visual Studio 2019 using the Raylib_cs framework as well a personal library of Math formulas.
This is a simple demonstration including a controllable tank and turret that can shoot rockets. There is an orange target that spawns around that can be fired at and destroyed.

Building this demo project requires Visual Studio 2019 or newer.
This demo is developed for .NET Core 3.1 and primarily supports Windows. Adjustment may be needed for other platforms.

To Build: Clone the repository from GitHub and open the solution in Visual Studio 2019 or newer.
This project uses Raylib_cs so you may need to "Restore NuGet Packages" after initial clone.
Both the soultion and project should be configured and ready to build.
Ctrl + Shift + B should build the project with no extra steps required.

Controls and Instructions:
Use your keyboard to control the tank and turret
Tank and Turret Controls:
W: moves the tank "forwards" according to its rotation
S: moves the tank "backwards" according to its rotation
A: rotates the tank and turret counter clockwise 
D: rotates the tank and turret clockwise 
Q: rotates the turret counter-clockwise
E: rotates the turret clockwise
